<h3>About Me</h3>
Hey there! Bilal Motiwala here. I'm a software developer with my hands in web applications, blockchain development and other side projects. I'm building Pyme as the co-founder and CTO. Other than that, I'm from Pakistan, been travelling around and a high school dropout.

<h3>What do I do?</h3>
I'm most famous for overcomplications, using a lot of words but then building solutions that work. Currently I'm taking it up a notch as the CTO of Pyme.

<h3>What can I work in and around?</h3>
There's an evergrowing list. I'm not a master in any yet more the jack of all trades type.

If you've come so far reading my bio, well, thanks!

Lastly, proudly blabbered with LOVE ðŸ’• and the power of **~~THOR~~** the Internet.
