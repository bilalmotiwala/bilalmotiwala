<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

I was born in Pakistan, lived mostly in Doha, Qatar and then again in Pakistan until I moved across to Tbilisi for my "education" (psst.. between us, it was more the wine and cheese stringing me along here) and been here since then. Well we can all agree the pandemic hasn't allowed a lot of travel now.

<h3 align="center">What do I do?</h3>

I'm really just more of passionate to being challenged and building something better. I've got my hands into enough places along the way to get where I am today but I think the good mix of this knowledge adventure and exploration allowed me to really create, guide and scale implementations and come up with nifty solutions to many problems around me.

<h3 align="center">What can I work in and around?</h3>

Oh boy. This is a really wide list but really, these are the ones I've sort of gone headfirst into. Some of these, I have personally made projects on for my university or for requirements during my professional experience yet most, I've just gone in blind and needed to figure my way through at work to `"resolve random unexpected and unwanted features"`
