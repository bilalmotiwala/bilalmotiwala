<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

Dark Clouds, Heavy Rain, The gusts of wind against the trees and be.... Rewind, too fictionous ðŸ˜‚

Well, I am a Senior Year Computer Engineering Student in the Bachelors Program at Ilia State University, Tbilisi, Georgia. I was born in Pakistan, lived mostly in Doha, Qatar and then again in Pakistan until I moved across to Tbilisi for my "education" (psst.. between us, it was more the wine and cheese stringing me along here)

<h3 align="center">What do I do?</h3>

I'm really just more of passionate to being challenged and building something better. I've got my essential skills in Database Development, Application Architecture, Front-End Development, Back-End Development and Machine Learning but I think the good mix of knowing them all has allowed me to really guide implementations and come up with nifty solutions to many problems around me.

<h3 align="center">What can I work in and around?</h3>

Oh boy. This is a really wide list but really, these are the ones I've sort of gone headfirst into. Some of these, I have personally made projects on for my university or for requirements during my professional experience yet most, I've just gone in blind and needed to figure my way through at work to `"resolve random unexpected and unwanted features"`
