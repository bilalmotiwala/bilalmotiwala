<h3>About Me</h3>
Hey there! Bilal Motiwala here. I'm the Founder and CTO of PymeDAO. Currently working on quite a few interesting projects under the PymeDAO flag (stay tuned). I'm from Pakistan and a college dropout. 

<h3>What am I best know as?</h3>
Chief Complications Officer. Know how to either make 'em or solve 'em. It's one or the other end of this spectrum for me.

This Github Profile is VERY out of date yet all projects are private so you'll have to make do.

Thanks for reading ðŸ’• via the power of **~~THOR~~** the Internet.
